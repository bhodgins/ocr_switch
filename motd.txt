Welcome to LuaOCR, an Ocranet compatible circuit switching switch. If you
are reading this, you (or your well respected administrator) may not have
edited their MOTD file located at motd.txt in the root directory of this
software package.

Administrators:
By default the switch is inactive. After configuring this switch, be sure
to fire up all systems with the following command:

	switch online

If you run into any problems, you may deactivate the switch temporarily
with the 'switch offline' command.
